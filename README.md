# Madhuri Photo Studio - MERN Starter

This archive contains a starter MERN project for the landing page design you provided.

## Structure
- backend/  -> Express server (api endpoint: POST /api/contact)
- frontend/ -> React app (minimal setup using react-scripts)

## Quick start (locally)

### Backend
```
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```
Server will run at http://localhost:5000

### Frontend
```
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
Frontend runs at http://localhost:3000 and calls the backend at http://localhost:5000 for the contact form.

## Notes
- The frontend includes a hero image copied from the workspace (Landingpage.png) at `public/images/hero.jpg`.
- This is a starter template — you can extend it by adding MongoDB integration, authentication, file uploads, and more.

Enjoy! 🎉
